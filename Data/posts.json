    "content": "I will show how I included a light/dark mode switch in my portfolio website to let users change between light and dark themes. So, the first thing I did was to add a button in the HTML file that would trigger toggling the theme. Then, I basically define two different classes in CSS for the light and dark modes with the right styles. Then I added an event listener to the button in JavaScript, so that upon clicking, this class toggles on and off on the body element. This will change dynamically with the current theme about what text the button contains: \"Switch to Dark Mode\" or \"Switch to Light Mode.\" A bit fiddly to enforce everything looking alike for both themes, but I styled every single element. Moreover, the processing of changes in button text is inside the event listener. Following these steps, I could turn some friendly toggle switching between light and dark modes into my portfolio."

    "content": "Here, I will show you how to charge and display blog posts from a JSON file using JavaScript. Here is how I did it: 1. Creating posts.json A new JSON file was created that held the blog posts. Each post basically has a title and some information. 2, JavaScript to Fetch Posts: I used the Fetch API to load the JSON file, parsed the JSON data, created HTML elements to hold each blog post, and appended them to the blog section of the page. 3. Style the Posts: Ensure that the styling of posts is consistent for every single post. I embedded some CSS classes to make my text readable and my appearance appealing."
